# Digital Twin

This project implements a digital twin system with a web-based client and a Node.js server. The system allows real-time control and monitoring of a physical device (such as a crane or robotic arm) via OPC UA, with a 3D visualization and live streaming interface.

## Project Structure

```
digital-twin-app/
├── client/   # React web application for visualization and control
└── server/   # Node.js backend for OPC UA communication and WebSocket API
```

---

## client

The `client` folder contains a React application built with Vite. It provides:

- A 3D digital twin visualization using Unity WebGL and Three.js.
- Real-time control buttons for device movement and claw operation.
- Live video streaming integration.
- WebSocket communication with the backend for sensor updates and control commands.

### Main Features

- **Unity WebGL Integration:** Embeds a Unity 3D model for interactive visualization.
- **Live Stream:** Displays a live video feed alongside the 3D model.
- **Real-Time Controls:** Buttons to move the device and operate the claw, synchronized with the backend.
- **Sensor Feedback:** Receives and displays real-time sensor data from the server.

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Access the app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or as configured in `.env`).

## server

The `server` folder contains a Node.js backend that:

- Connects to an OPC UA server to control actuators and read sensors.
- Exposes a REST API and WebSocket API for the client.
- Relays control commands from the client to the OPC UA server.
- Broadcasts real-time sensor updates to all connected clients.

### Main Features

- **OPC UA Integration:** Reads and writes to PLC/OPC UA nodes for device control.
- **WebSocket API:** Real-time communication with the client for sensor updates and control.
- **REST API:** Endpoints for direct control and sensor reading.
- **Environment Configuration:** Uses `.env` for endpoint and port settings.

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
2. Configure `.env` with your OPC UA endpoint and client origin.
3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
4. The server will run on the port specified in `.env` (default: 3001).

## Environment Variables

Both `client` and `server` use `.env` files for configuration. See the provided `.env` files in each folder for examples.
